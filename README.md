# Design Of Machine Elements
## Evaluate the maximum stress developed in a specimen when it is subjected to bending moment

This program is designed to evaluate the maximum stress developed in a specimen when it is subjected to bending moment. The user is first asked to enter the type of section for which the maximum stresses need to be calculated. Then the dimensions are entered which are used to determine the value of Kt from the Design Data Handbook. An option is provided to the user if they want to find out the value of factor of safety when the bending moment is reversed.
This program uses basic functions of C++ programming and a special function of graphics.h to sketch the sections of the specimen.

A Simple Example that the program solves is:

Determine the magnitude and location of maximum stresses in the machine member. Factor of safety is 2. What grade of steel do you suggest? If the bending moment of the specimen is completely reversed, what will be the factor of safety?
